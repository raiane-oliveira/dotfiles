# Dotfiles
The most important dotfiles settings I have configured on my Linux machine.

> OBS: most of them only work on Unix-based systems

## Where are the actual file locations?
Most of them are in the path `~/.config`. Those that aren't are listed below:

- `gnome/icons` -> `.local/shared/.icons` is the real path to put it in
- `gnome/themes` -> `~/.themes`
- `scripts` -> `~/scripts`
- `tmux/.tmux.conf` -> `~/.tmux.conf`
- `vim/.vimrc` -> `~/.vimrc`
- `vim/.ideavimrc` -> `~/.ideavimrc`
- `wezterm/colors` -> `~/.config/wezterm/colors`
- `wezterm/.wezterm.lua` -> `~/.wezterm.lua`
